# My Website

## Description

This is a website that I made combining features that I like from other websites.

## How it works

It works by using a bunch of code. It's a website.

## Usage

You're better off not using it. I would recommend building your own, but if you're adamant on using my website, I'm not going to stop you.

## Dependencies

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine to run this project. Optionally, you may use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run the project in a container.

## Installation

### Node.js

1. Clone the repository and change directory into it.
2. Install necessary dependencies with `npm i`.
3. Start the app using `npm run dev`.

### Docker

1. Clone the repository and change directory into it.
2. Build the Docker image with `docker build -t my-website .`.
3. To run the container, use `docker run my-website`.
